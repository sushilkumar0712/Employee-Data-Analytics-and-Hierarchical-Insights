The project involved analysing employee and department data using SQL to derive actionable insights for organizational management. It focused on querying a relational database with two tablesâ€”employee (containing employee details like ID, name, department ID, salary, manager ID, age, and date of birth) and dept (containing department ID and name). The project addressed 15 complex business questions, covering salary comparisons, departmental analysis, and hierarchical relationships, achieving comprehensive data exploration and reporting.
